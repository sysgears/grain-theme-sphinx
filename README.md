Contributing
============

Any person or company wanting to contribute to this project should follow
the following rules in order to their contribution being accepted.

Sign your Work
--------------

We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits.  This
certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to
submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be
accepted.

To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when
committing your changes:

    $ git commit -s -m "Adding a new widget driver for cogs."

This will append the following to your commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>

By doing this you certify the below:

    Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

If you wish to add the signoff to the commit message on your every commit
without the need to specify -s or --signoff, rename
.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample to .git/hooks/commit-msg and uncomment the lines:

``` sh
SOB=$(git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT | sed -n 's/^\(.*>\).*$/Signed-off-by: \1/p')
grep -qs "^$SOB" "$1" || echo "$SOB" >> "$1"
```
